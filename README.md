Overview

This project involves creating a Python-based system to generate FHIR-compliant synthetic referrals and send them to a configurable API endpoint. It simulates real-world scenarios in healthcare technology, focusing on generating, formatting, and transmitting structured healthcare data. Students will gradually learn how to build a robust, modular, and scalable system while working with real-world healthcare data standards by breaking the project into manageable steps.

The project teaches technical skills like Python programming and API integration and emphasizes the importance of working with structured data, healthcare identifiers, and configuration management.
